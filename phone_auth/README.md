### 3) Copy the `lib` folder in the repo and past it in your project
`Note:` OTP will not send to your phone number if you are in the `spark plan` in Firebase.
### 4) Install Required package
```bash
flutter pub add firebase_auth
flutter pub add firebase_core
flutter pub add country_code_picker
```
### 5) Run your App
`Note:` Use the phone number and OTP that you added in the Auth service. Other than that, no other phone number will work.

### 6) All Done Thank you
